# python-challenge

#Both PyBank and PyPoll have their solutions in their respective folders. 
#For PyBank, main.py will have the main Python code while the "Analysis" folder will have the text file with the correct output.
#For PyPoll, this is the same as above, again, in their respective folders.
#Had trouble pulling with some errors and was personally noted by me in the scripts as comments, so please excuse that!
